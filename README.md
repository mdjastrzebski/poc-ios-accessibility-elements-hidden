## iOS: `accessibilityElementsHidden` property showcase

This repo showcases the effects of using `accessibilityElementsHidden` property in iOS apps. This [meaning of this property is not documented](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject-swift.class/accessibilityelementshidden), and people infer different meanings for it.

In this POC I showcase that `accessibilityElementsHidden` affects both element on which is set as we all as the contained elements.
